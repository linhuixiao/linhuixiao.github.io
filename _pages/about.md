Linhui Xiao is currently a research assistant at Pengcheng Laboratory. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the National Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. His doctoral advisors were [Prof. Changsheng Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=hI9NRDkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Xiaoshan Yang](https://yangxs.ac.cn/home). During his doctoral period, he entered Pengcheng Laboratory for joint cultivation under the guidance of [Prof. Yaowei Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=o_DllmIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Lan Xiangyuan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=c3iwWRcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). He obtained his Master's degree from the State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where his advisor was [Prof. Xudong Zou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Fku_O9IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). He has long focused on the research of key technologies in artificial intelligence and visual grounding, publishing a series of influential research works in the top international journals and conferences on artificial intelligence (eg. NeurIPS, ACM MM, TMM, TNNLS, TPAMI, RAS, etc.) as the first author. As the first inventor or student first inventor, he has accumulated over 15 Chinese and international invention patents (including 12 authorized Chinese patents and two international patents), and served as a reviewer for more than 10 top international journals and conferences in the field of artificial intelligence. His current research interests include artificial intelligence, multimodal learning, multimodal visual grounding, three-dimensional visual grounding, etc.
